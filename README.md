# EventMap

Description:

	This is a native iOS application.

	It allows a user to view a events from ticketmaster in their area. The user can view that event
	and add it to a list of events for them to view later. The use can specify the radius in miles that events should appear within, the
	total number of events to view on a map, and how far in the future the events should be.

	note: You need xcode to be able to try this out since it is not on the app store, I will work on deploying it to the app store.

How to run on iPhone Simulator:

	1) Download and unzip the project
	2) Open the project in xcode (you can just double click the .xcodeproj file)
	3) Select the simulator to run the app on, I usually go with iphone 6
	4) Click the build and run button (its the play button at the top left)

	note: Since this app uses your location and the simulator does not have access to that
		  your actual location will not be used, I believe the default on the simulator is
		  San Fransico. 

How to run on iPhone device:
